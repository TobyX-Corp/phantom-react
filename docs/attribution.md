# Attribution

By using the phantom Platform, you agree to include attribution to phantom Media in your AR/VR applications. There are several options where you can proudly refer to phantom Media as your platform!

## Guidelines
**Size**

The logo must not be smaller than 90dp on screen

## 1. Full 360 Intro Splash
This is the preferred method of attribution. Use this full 360 screen at the start of your app as it loads.

## 2. Title Screen
Use this logo anywhere on your own custom title screen. We don't have strict guidelines where you need to place the logo, it just needs to be clear with the proper contrast. We provide you with 2 options that work on light or dark backgrounds:

## 3. App Store Description
Lastly, including "Powered by phantom Media" in your app store description is another acceptable option.
