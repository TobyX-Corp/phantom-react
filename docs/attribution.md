# Attribution

By using the Viro Platform, you agree to include attribution to Viro Media in your AR/VR applications. There are several options where you can proudly refer to Viro Media as your platform!

## Guidelines
**Size**

The logo must not be smaller than 90dp on screen

**Color**

The Viro colors are Viro blue and Viro pink. No logo treatments of either color are allowed. But, logo treatments in all black or all white are allowed.

?> Viro Blue

?> Hex #34c5f7

?> RGB 52,197,247

!> Viro Pink

!> Hex #ff3f5f

!> RGB 255,63,95

If background colors other than black or white are used, the background must provide adequate contrast for the logo.

## 1. Full 360 Intro Splash
This is the preferred method of attribution. Use this full 360 screen at the start of your app as it loads.

## 2. Title Screen
Use this logo anywhere on your own custom title screen. We don't have strict guidelines where you need to place the logo, it just needs to be clear with the proper contrast. We provide you with 2 options that work on light or dark backgrounds:

## 3. App Store Description
Lastly, including "Powered by Viro Media" in your app store description is another acceptable option.
