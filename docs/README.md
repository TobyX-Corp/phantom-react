# Overview

Latest Release is v2.17.0 as of October 16, 2019

See the [Releases](releases.md) tab for more information

ViroReact is a platform for developers to rapidly build native cross platform AR/VR applications using React Native. ViroReact supports:

AR: [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/) and [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/)

VR: [Cardboard](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/) (iOS and Android), [Daydream](https://arvr.google.com/daydream/) and [Gear VR](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/)

The platform is composed of two main components:

A high performance native 3D rendering engine, and

A custom extension of [React](https://reactjs.org/) for AR and VR development.

Whether you are looking to build a new AR/VR application, or add AR/VR features to your existing applications, the ViroReact platform enables you to create powerful mobile AR/VR applications using a single code base. Write once, run everywhere!

## Why Use ViroReact?
## Easy to Learn
Our framework uses web-like concepts making it simple to learn.


## Open Source
As of Viro React v2.17.0 we are now open source under the MIT License. Add, customize or extend Viro any you want. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/viromedia/viro).

## Fast Development
Tired of waiting for recompile to see changes? With Viro React Testbed Apps, just reload and see your changes on device. It's like "refreshing" a browser.


## AR/VR Integration
In addition to creating entirely new applications, with ViroReact, you can add AR/VR functionality to your existing application and offer your user base more exciting features.


## Cross Platform
VR support for iOS Cardboard, Android Cardboard, Daydream and Gear VR.

AR support for iOS ARKit and Android ARCore.


## Native Performance
The Viro renderer runs natively on your hardware for optimal performance. Create stunning scenes with support for physically-based rendering (PBR), high-dynamic range (HDR), and realtime lighting and shadows. Add real-world mechanics to your objects with Viro's physics engine, and emit smoke, fire, and more with Viro's full-featured particle system.
